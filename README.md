- **Loops**: For, while, and do-while loops used in various problem-solving scenarios.
- **Patterns**: Techniques to generate common patterns (e.g., triangles, squares, etc.) through loops and logic.
- **Functions**: Writing modular code with functions, including recursion.
- **Arrays**: Working with arrays for storing and manipulating data.
- **Pointers**: Understanding and using pointers for memory management and data manipulation (in languages like C/C++).
